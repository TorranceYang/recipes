12. Add in frozen vegetables
13. Add slurry of cornstarch in water into stew until desired thickness is reached
14. Season with salt + msg and a pinch of sugar to taste

## Tips

- Add whatever seasonings you'd like in addition to the base ones - garlic powder, onion powder, basil, oregano
- If you don't like your root vegetables super mushy, add them after step 9. Should leave in aromatics though
- Top off with extra broth if vegetables + meat are peeking over the liquid at any step
- Season as you go if you're just cooking for yourself
- Don't skip the sugar! It can cut some of the leftover acidity from the tomato paste. Also can compensate for a dryer wine
